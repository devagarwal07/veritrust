Scoping notes:

- App router is used and components are TypeScript-ready.
- Do not run `npm install` automatically in this session. The developer should run it locally to install dependencies and start the dev server.
- This scaffold focuses on the frontend; integration points (API endpoints, blockchain wallet hooks) are left as TODOs in components.
